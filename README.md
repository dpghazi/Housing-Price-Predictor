# Housing Price Predictor

## Project Description
Building machine learning models that can predict the price of apartments in the city of Buenos Aires — with a focus on apartments that cost less than $400,000 USD & Mexico City — with a focus on apartments that cost less than $100,000 USD.

### Overview
* Created linear regression models using the scikit-learn library.
* Built data pipelines for imputing missing values and encoding categorical features.
* Improved models performance by reducing overfitting.
* Created a dynamic dashboard for interacting with completed models.

### Tools & Libraries
* Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit-learn)
